          [This section is called "Praise of the Deity"]—that is, the poet's praising either the
          deity whom he himself follows or the deity appropriate to the subject he has taken up. One
          should know that, between these [two], this praise is of(?) the deity
          appropriate [to the subject matter]. Why? Understand that, for the sake of the goals of
          man—which, by [virtue of the three] guṇas beginning with sattva, are [likewise] three—the
          primordial divinity becomes the Three [Forms] through those [same guṇas; therefore,] because there is
          a (logical?) connection with [that primordial deity,] the praising of those three goals and of those
          Three [Forms] for the sake of the audience(? more lit. "for those who have experienced the
          speaking") will [follow] in due course; hence, he has spoken in such a way that this
          [initial] Praise applies equally (more lit. "is/becomes in common") to all the Three.

          This is a comparison of the [subject] taken up concerning its superiority [and that of the
          thing to which it is compared]. One must grasp that the superiority of the letter A [comes
          about] through its being produced in the form of Pure Sound (nādamātra) without
          modifcation [through the organs of speech, etc.], and that the superiority of the Lord
          [comes about] through His understanding everything/completely through natural
          understanding, without artificial understanding. The sage has said "all characters" with a
          view to the fact that, apart from just the Tamil script, [the letter A] is also first in
          the northern [i.e. Sanskrit] script. "Primordial Lord" is a compound [showing?]
          qualification [composed of?] a combination(?) of two nouns[—in other words, ātipakavaṉ is
          what would be called a karmadhāraya in Sanskrit—"the Lord Who is the Origin"]; an ending
          in northern [i.e. Sanskrit] treatises(???). The [term] "world" here stands in [the sense of]
          "living [beings]"(?). Because it is necessary to state the existence of the deity, Who is
          invisible to a world that is visible, he has said "the world is in fact something with the
          primordial Lord as its beginning, "placing" ["the primordial Lord" as a qualifier?] upon
          the world; even if he has spoken [thus], one must grasp "The primordial Lord is the
          beginning to/of the world" as the intention. The letter "ē" [here] occurs in [the sense
          of expressing] certainty. In this manner, the Lord's existence has been expressed.
